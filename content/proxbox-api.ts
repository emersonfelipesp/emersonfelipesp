    "FastAPI orchestrator that bridges Proxmox VE and NetBox for the Proxbox suite.",
  description: [
    "proxbox-api is the FastAPI service that powers the Proxbox stack. It is the engine behind every Full Update click you see inside the netbox-proxbox NetBox plugin.",
    "It exposes REST, Server-Sent Events and WebSocket endpoints so the plugin can discover, sync and stream live progress for clusters, nodes, VMs, containers, storage, snapshots and backups.",
    "Internally it stands on two SDKs: netbox-sdk talks to the NetBox REST API as the write target, and proxmox-sdk talks to Proxmox VE as the read source. proxbox-api is the only place where both worlds are reconciled.",
